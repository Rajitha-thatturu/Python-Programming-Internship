#NUmber guessing game
"""
Below is a Python implementation of a Number Guessing Game
 where the computer generates a random number, 
 and the player tries to guess it within a certain number of attempts.
 we can import random nubers as our wish. Here I take  the numbers 
 betwenn 1 to 50 , we can import as we wish.

    # Generate a random number between 1 and 50
    secret_number = random.randint(1, 50)

    max_attempts = 10
    # Initialize the number of attempts made by the player
    attempts = 0

    # Welcome message for the player
    print("Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!")
    # Informing the player about the range of the secret number
    print(f"I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 50. Can you guess it?")

    # Loop until the player runs out of attempts or guesses the number
    while attempts < max_attempts:
        try:

            # Increment the number of attempts
            attempts += 1

            # Check if the player's guess is correct
            if guess == secret_number:
                # Congratulate the player and break the loop if the guess is correct
